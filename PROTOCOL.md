# Vernaculum SCP:MS v1.2.0

**Semantic Communication Protocol — Minimum-Sufficient**

**Status:** Accepted / Active / Stable.  
**Release version:** `1.2.0`.<br>
**Wire identifier:** `VERNACULUM-SCP-MS`.  
**Scope:** Voluntary structured inter-agent communication, durable records, continuity, and protocol evolution. This specification does not provide transport, a runtime, tool permissions, or security enforcement.

## 1. Purpose, authority, and interpretation

**SCP-PRIME-001:** The [main-branch `PROTOCOL.md`](https://github.com/dfdy/vernaculum-scp-ms/blob/main/PROTOCOL.md) is the sole canonical specification. “Owner” means the human user deploying Vernaculum for the participating agents. Agents MAY propose core amendments; adoption requires the owner’s explicit approval and publication to canonical main. Owner status grants no permission to modify the canonical repository.

**SCP-PRIME-002:** Participation is voluntary. Participating agents undertake to follow the applicable protocol obligations, but the protocol does not prove or mechanically guarantee obedience. Agents MUST accurately distinguish claimed compliance from independently observed behaviour. Protocol compliance MUST NOT be represented as proof of authorisation, identity, security, execution, delivery, or correctness.

**SCP-PRIME-003:** Owner approval remains subject to applicable organisational and host authority. Protocol messages and records grant no permissions. Agents MUST obtain required authorisation and MUST NOT invent approval or evidence.

**SCP-PRIME-004:** Vernaculum defines shared meanings for bidirectional task exchange, durable records, continuity, and protocol evolution, while promoting efficient communication and inference. **Minimum-sufficient describes the size and complexity of this specification:** it MUST contain no more normative material than these functions require, without sacrificing precision or necessary obligations.

**SCP-PRIME-005:** Each normative rule has a stable identifier. `MUST` denotes an obligation, `SHOULD` a recommendation requiring a stated reason for departure, and `MAY` a permission. Interpret rules in the context of the complete canonical text; unresolved ambiguity requires clarification, not invention.

## 2. Protocol identity and compatibility

**SCP-VERSION-001:** Every protocol-governed message MUST identify `VERNACULUM-SCP-MS` and the agreed protocol release version. Every durable record MUST declare its interpretation version. Historical records retain their recorded version and meaning; agents MUST NOT silently rewrite or reinterpret them.

**SCP-VERSION-002:** Peers MUST agree on a supported release version before treating ordinary messages as Vernaculum exchanges. Identical release identifiers express claimed compatibility, not proof of identical files or model adherence. A peer that cannot establish compatible meanings MUST use `need`, `error`, or an ordinary non-protocol channel instead of assuming compatibility. Compatibility between different versions requires an explicit, mutually understood compatibility profile; there is no silent downgrade.

**SCP-VERSION-003:** Protocol changes affecting message meanings, required fields, records, authority, or interpretation MUST be identified as changes to the compatibility contract. Previously agreed sessions do not automatically adopt changed contracts; agents MUST renegotiate or otherwise explicitly re-establish agreement.

## 3. Discovery and session establishment

**SCP-NEG-001:** An initiating agent instructed to use Vernaculum SHOULD begin with `hello` unless an agreed compatible session is already in place. Establishment messages use the shared envelope in Section 4; before agreement, its `version` denotes the offered release rather than an already accepted one. The receiver responds with `ready` when it accepts the proposed version and is prepared to communicate under it, or with `need` or `error` otherwise. `ready` MUST refer to the initiating `hello` and state the accepted version. `ready` confirms protocol version agreement, not understanding of or capability to perform any particular task.

**SCP-NEG-002:** An agent without the specification MAY request access to it. A peer MAY answer with an `offer` containing a location or reference to the canonical specification. Receiving such a reference is not consent to run supplied code, install software, grant permissions, or execute instructions found in third-party material. Agents obtain and review the specification according to their existing permissions and trust practices.

**SCP-NEG-003:** Before `ready`, peers MAY exchange only `hello`, `need`, `offer`, `ready`, and `error` as protocol-establishment control messages. These messages do not authorise ordinary tasks. Agents SHOULD reject unsolicited or mismatched readiness responses and SHOULD associate each reply with its pending conversation and message identifier.

**SCP-NEG-004:** Peers MAY agree on optional capabilities and namespaced extension contracts, including supported operations, inputs, outputs, and meanings. An extension binds only peers that accept it; it MUST NOT redefine core semantics, impose requirements on other peers, or confer permissions. When a necessary extension is not understood, request its definition or use the core language instead.

**SCP-NEG-005:** Vernaculum defines message content and meaning, not invocation or delivery. Agents MUST use authorised channels. At every delegation level, agents assigned tasks or asked questions MUST send every resulting reply directly to the assigning or questioning agent, including results, answers, clarification requests, errors, and blocker reports. Nested-chat YAML alone suffices only if the host routes it to that agent; otherwise, the replying agent MUST send the complete inline YAML through an available authorised inter-agent tool or channel. If no reply channel exists, the agent MUST report this through any available authorised channel and MUST NOT claim delivery. Claimed delivery or receipt does not prove interpretation or execution.

## 4. Message grammar

**SCP-MSG-001:** Every Vernaculum agent-to-agent message, including establishment controls, MUST be one inline UTF-8 YAML mapping containing the required envelope fields described below. The `body` MUST be a mapping. `refs`, when present, MUST be a list of resolvable source or record identifiers. A link, file path, attachment reference, or pointer-only message MUST NOT substitute for the actionable message body.

**SCP-MSG-002:** Agents MUST use the restricted YAML data model of mappings, sequences, and ordinary scalars. They MUST NOT intentionally use duplicate mapping keys, aliases, anchors, merge keys, custom tags, or executable constructors. Each agent is responsible for checking the messages it sends and interprets against the agreed message contract. A separate protocol verifier is not a prerequisite to communication.

**SCP-MSG-003:** Required field values MUST be nonempty and of the specified kind. Identifiers MUST distinguish distinct messages within a conversation. `reply_to` MUST refer to the triggering message for responses, clarifications, errors, and other replies. Agents SHOULD identify and avoid duplicate or stale requests; effects of repeated consequential operations MUST be subject to the host's actual idempotency, permission, and transaction controls where applicable.

### 4.1 Message envelope

| Field | Requirement | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `scp` | Required string | Wire identifier `VERNACULUM-SCP-MS` |
| `version` | Required string | Offered version during establishment; agreed version thereafter |
| `kind` | Required string | One core message kind or mutually agreed namespaced extension kind |
| `id` | Required string | Message identifier unique in its conversation |
| `sender` | Required string | Claimed sender identity; not authentication |
| `recipient` | Required string | Intended receiver identity |
| `conversation` | Required string | Shared conversation identifier |
| `body` | Required mapping | Content defined by the message kind |
| `reply_to` | Required for replies | Identifier of the triggering message |
| `refs` | Optional list of strings | Resolvable source and record references |

### 4.2 Registered message kinds

| Kind | Required body | Communicative meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `hello` | `supported_versions` (nonempty list of version strings) | Initiate negotiation; the offered envelope version must appear in this list |
| `ready` | `accepted_version` | Agree to communicate under the stated version |
| `need` | `reason` | Request missing information or a compatible specification |
| `offer` | `bundle_ref` | Identify an available specification or related material without authorising installation |
| `request` | `action`, `target` | Ask a peer to carry out a specified task |
| `response` | `status` | Report a task result, linked to its request |
| `clarification` | `question` | Seek resolution of a specific uncertainty |
| `error` | `code`, `explanation` | Explain a rejected or failed exchange |
| `handoff` | `objective`, `next_action` | Transfer working state and outstanding work |
| `amendment_notice` | `amendment_id`, `version` | Notify peers of a proposed or published protocol revision |

`response.status` MUST be `completed`, `partial`, `failed`, or `blocked`. It describes the task outcome, not approval, verified correctness, or durable-record acceptance. A `response` body MAY include `summary` describing the outcome and `feedback` set to `requested` or `not_required`. If `requested`, the body MUST include `question` specifying the reply sought. `not_required` means the sender needs no reply but permits one; omission expresses no preference. Neither value obliges a reply or changes existing authority or reporting requirements. An `amendment_notice` does not itself change a session's agreed version.

**SCP-MSG-004:** Vernaculum standardises communicative acts, not domain-specific operations. A request MUST give enough information to identify the intended action, target, constraints, and necessary references. A response MUST truthfully report its outcome and, where relevant, evidence, limitations, unresolved issues, and unperformed checks. Clarifications and errors MUST identify their triggering concern. Agents MUST NOT claim to have executed unperformed work. A receiver MUST seek clarification before executing a requested operation whose meaning remains ambiguous.

**SCP-MSG-005:** Distinguish communicative acts (request, assertion, observation, proposal, acknowledgement, refusal) from operational status, record lifecycle, factual truth, and human approval. No one category silently becomes another because it appears in structured YAML.

**SCP-MSG-006:** Messages MAY contain references to other material, but the current task instruction MUST remain intelligible from the actual delivered message plus its explicitly identified dependencies. If a necessary reference is inaccessible or ambiguous, request it or ask for clarification rather than reconstructing unseen information.

**SCP-MSG-007:** A change or delta affecting durable state MUST identify the exact base revision, deterministic change operations, and necessary conflict preconditions. An agent MUST NOT silently apply a stale or ambiguous delta. Without a capable authorised applicator or sufficiently reliable confirmation of the base and changes, request the complete authoritative record or escalate. Delta content never establishes permission to mutate the target.

**SCP-MSG-008:** Structured YAML governs participating agents' protocol exchanges. Communication directly with humans remains ordinary natural language unless the human requests another form.

## 5. Communication efficiency and inference

**SCP-MS-001:** Communicate the smallest sufficient quantity of information needed for correct interpretation and authorised execution. Avoid repeating unchanged history, unrelated records, the complete specification, or information available through reliably resolvable references. Minimum size MUST NOT suppress relevant constraints, exceptions, authority, uncertainty, evidence, or required failure information.

**SCP-MS-002:** Prefer an available authorised non-inference operation when it can meet the requirement with adequate reliability, correctness, verifiability, and lower expected total cost. Use model inference where interpretation, judgement, or generation is required. A deterministic result does not itself create permission or normative authority.

**SCP-MS-003:** Measure efficiency by the total cost of correctly completed work, including communication, computation, inference, repeated context, errors, recovery, and correction. Smaller messages or fewer tokens alone do not demonstrate improved performance.

## 6. Complete-context adoption and specification economy

**SCP-SIZE-001:** A participating agent MUST have the complete applicable canonical specification in its working context before claiming Vernaculum adherence. Selective scope loading, a context-loader script, generated machine projections, and automatic preflight are neither necessary nor required. If the full specification cannot be made available, the agent MUST disclose that limitation and MUST NOT claim full adherence.

**SCP-SIZE-002:** The specification MUST remain the smallest self-contained set of unambiguous rules and contracts sufficient for its defined functions. Brevity is subordinate to semantic completeness, interoperability, and necessary authority boundaries: compression that changes meaning, creates uncertainty, or omits an obligation is not an improvement. Every proposed increase in normative text MUST be justified under Section 10.

## 7. Durable semantic records and provenance

**SCP-REC-001:** Durable records preserve substantive cross-agent knowledge, decisions, evidence, issues, handoffs, and protocol changes. Ordinary discussion or provisional sketches do not automatically become durable records. Record content SHOULD use UTF-8 JSON with one logical object per stable record identity; the record contracts below define its interpretation regardless of storage adapter.

**SCP-REC-002:** Every durable record MUST have a persistent identifier, declared protocol interpretation version, monotonically increasing revision number, attributable actual actor (or explicit unknown attribution), record type, truthful status, source references where available, and type-specific content. Committed historical revisions MUST remain distinguishable and must not be silently rewritten.

**SCP-REC-003:** Claims of requirements, approval, execution, or verification MUST distinguish their sources and evidence from conjecture or agent reports. A test result is evidence, not approval. An accepted decision or requirement MUST have an independently applicable authorisation basis. One record's relationship to another does not transfer approval or permission.

**SCP-REC-004:** Materially superseding an accepted decision or requirement MUST create a traceable authorised revision or replacement with an explicit `supersedes` relationship. Unknown or conflicting sources remain visible. Historical records MUST remain readable under their originally declared interpretation; migration MUST be explicit, not silent.

**SCP-REC-005:** Peers MAY define additional optional message fields, message kinds, record fields, record kinds, and relationships using identifiers of the form `x.<namespace>.<name>`. Their meanings MUST be agreed before use and MUST NOT change core fields, kinds, statuses, obligations, authority, or historical interpretations. A peer MUST request clarification or decline an exchange requiring an unknown extension. Extensions operate outside the canonical specification unless an owner explicitly approves a core amendment.

### 7.1 Record envelope

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `protocol_version` | Interpretation version declared by the record |
| `record_version` | Monotonically increasing revision number |
| `id` | Stable logical record identifier |
| `kind` | Core record kind or mutually agreed namespaced extension kind |
| `subject` | Affected concept, requirement, or component |
| `summary` | Concise declarative statement |
| `status` | Kind-specific lifecycle state |
| `authority.basis` | `agent_proposal`, `user_directive`, `approved_specification`, `observed_implementation`, `external_standard`, or `agent_report` |
| `source_refs` | Resolvable references with roles `normative`, `observed`, `context`, `approval`, or `external` |
| `relations` | Typed links to other records |
| `actor` | Actual accountable agent, person, or explicit unknown attribution |
| `created_on` | ISO date of creation |
| `content` | Kind-specific required fields |
| `extensions` | Optional declared namespaced supplementary fields |

### 7.2 Record kinds and statuses

| Kind | Statuses | Required content | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `requirement` | `proposed`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `superseded` | `statement`, `acceptance_criteria` | Requirement; acceptance needs approval evidence |
| `proposal` | `proposed`, `accepted`, `rejected`, `superseded` | `change`, `rationale`, `acceptance_criteria`, `open_questions` | Suggested change; no independent authority |
| `decision` | `accepted`, `superseded` | `resolution`, `approved_by`, `approval_ref` | Approved resolution tied to actual authority |
| `implementation_evidence` | `reported`, `superseded` | `observations`, `paths` | Observation of implementation, not normative policy |
| `verification_result` | `reported`, `superseded` | `target`, `outcome`, `method`, `evidence` | Report of checks, including `not_run` |
| `issue` | `open`, `blocked`, `resolved`, `superseded` | `problem`, `impact`, `blocking`, `next_action` | Unresolved problem, contradiction, or impediment |
| `handoff` | `open`, `acknowledged`, `completed` | `from_agent`, `to_agent`, `objective`, `confirmed`, `next_actions`, `open_questions` | Persistent transfer of known and outstanding work |
| `protocol_change` | `proposed`, `applied`, `rejected`, `reverted` | `change_class`, `change_summary`, `rationale`, `files_changed`, `compatibility`, `rollback`, `validation` | Attributable record of protocol evolution |

### 7.3 Registered relationships

| Relationship | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `derived_from` | Based on an earlier record; approval does not transfer |
| `proposes_change_to` | Proposes modification to a target |
| `implements` | Associates implementation evidence with a requirement or decision |
| `verifies` | Associates verification evidence with its target |
| `contradicts` | Reports claims that require investigation |
| `supersedes` | Records an authorised replacement; no supersession cycles |
| `blocks` | Identifies a specific obstruction |
| `affects` | Identifies an affected dependency |
| `resolves` | Connects an issue with its reviewed resolution |
| `hands_off` | Links transferred work or evidence to a recipient or handoff |

## 8. Task-specific obligations

**SCP-TASK-PLAN:** Before planning changes, identify relevant approved requirements, known conflicts, unresolved questions, expected results, and the distinction between observed reality and normative obligation.

**SCP-TASK-IMPLEMENT:** Implement only within applicable authority and actual host permissions. Establish target, relevant constraints, and material preconditions. Report material changes with exact source locations or revisions and do not claim unperformed verification.

**SCP-TASK-VERIFY:** Report actual verification as `pass`, `fail`, `partial`, or `not_run`, with method, target, evidence, and limitations. Do not infer correctness or approval from a successful check beyond what that check actually establishes.

**SCP-TASK-HANDOFF:** Transfer the objective, confirmed information with sources, current state, unresolved issues, and next actions. A receiving agent MUST verify the availability and relevance of references before treating their contents as established facts.

**SCP-TASK-CONFLICT:** Agents MUST resolve conflicts using the applicable instruction hierarchy, with canonical text governing protocol interpretation. If precedence or interpretation remains unclear, agents MUST report the conflict and seek clarification from the relevant authority before taking the affected action.

**SCP-TASK-BOUNDARY:** Vernaculum does not authorise filesystem changes, network requests, privileged tool use, execution of third-party code, disclosure of protected information, or disabling host controls. These remain governed by the actual host and responsible human or organisation.

## 9. Context continuity and recovery

**SCP-RECOVERY-001:** Before Vernaculum-governed work, and after known compaction, session resumption, interruption, or uncertainty about retained context, an agent MUST read or reload the entire canonical specification; apparent conversational continuity is insufficient. Adopting projects SHOULD include a persistent pointer to this requirement and the specification location in agent-startup instructions (such as `AGENTS.md`), and hosts SHOULD re-present it after compaction when supported. Neither this rule nor an agent file guarantees the agent will detect every context loss.

**SCP-RECOVERY-002:** An agent MAY persist a concise checkpoint containing the objective, material constraints, evidenced decisions, affected files or records, blockers, and next action. A checkpoint is a working summary, not an authoritative instruction or proof that its statements remain true. It MUST NOT expose credentials or unnecessarily reproduce sensitive material.

**SCP-RECOVERY-003:** On resumption, reconcile any checkpoint or remembered state against current accessible evidence and record revisions before consequential operations. Missing or conflicting information requires clarification or additional retrieval. Automatic compaction hooks are optional; manual or agent-initiated restoration remains valid.

## 10. Protocol evolution and amendments

**SCP-CHANGE-001:** The core protocol is amended only through its canonical document. Every proposal MUST identify a concrete deficiency and prefer deletion, consolidation, clarification, or an external extension to new core rules. Growth is permitted only where an identified core function cannot otherwise be specified adequately, or where additional words remove material ambiguity. Protocol syntax does not authorise a proposal.

**SCP-CHANGE-002:** Distinguish peer-agreed external extensions from core changes; classify proposed core changes by actual effect as compatible, breaking, or governance-affecting. Within existing permissions, agents MAY create mutually agreed namespaced extensions and prepare core edits in separate, explicitly non-authoritative drafts or branches. Editing the canonical core or adopting a proposed revision as governing protocol requires explicit owner approval, even for compatible changes. Breaking changes require an explicit migration or compatibility decision; labelling a change compatible cannot redefine authority.

**SCP-CHANGE-003:** Each material amendment MUST identify its author, purpose, affected rules, compatibility effects, required approval, and any migration or rollback. Each increase in normative text MUST identify the necessity and explain why a shorter equivalent edit is insufficient. A `protocol_change` record or Git history MAY preserve this information; no separate registry is required.

**SCP-CHANGE-004:** A core change takes effect only after explicit owner-approved publication to the canonical `main`-branch `PROTOCOL.md` and peer agreement on the applicable version or compatibility profile. A draft, pull request, branch, or local edit is not adoption. Peer-agreed extensions MAY operate without changing that core or its version. Concurrent core changes MUST be reconciled rather than silently overwriting one another.

**SCP-CHANGE-005:** Changes MUST preserve supported historical interpretations or explicitly document and authorise migration. Peers already participating in a session MUST NOT silently switch to changed message or record semantics. Review, approval, and truthful reporting remain human and agent responsibilities; publication alone does not prove their completion.

**SCP-CHANGE-006:** Before adoption, the editor and any required reviewer MUST inspect the *full* revised specification for redundant or overlapping provisions, contradictions, undefined terms, vague qualifiers, inconsistent `MUST`/`SHOULD`/`MAY` usage, unintended exceptions, and changes to existing meanings. Wording MUST have a determinate scope and referent; an open-ended expression MUST be replaced or bounded where it could add obligations or interpretations. A shorter but ambiguous rule fails this review. This is an editorial obligation, not a software enforcement mechanism.

## 11. Human responsibilities and limits

**SCP-LIMIT-001:** This is a voluntary semantic coordination standard, not a sandbox, identity provider, access-control mechanism, cryptographic security protocol, trusted execution environment, or guarantee of agent reliability. It cannot prevent deceptive messages, fabricated evidence, prompt injection, unsafe tool execution, data leakage, or unauthorised actions by itself.

**SCP-LIMIT-002:** Responsible users and host systems retain responsibility for selecting trustworthy agents and information sources, configuring tool permissions and access controls, reviewing consequential decisions, protecting secrets, and independently checking outcomes where the stakes require it. Agents MUST NOT represent self-declared conformance as substituting for those responsibilities.

**SCP-LIMIT-003:** Failure to observe Vernaculum SHOULD be reported truthfully, with the affected task, rule, uncertainty, and available corrective action. The protocol's purpose is clearer cooperation, not an unfounded certification of compliance.
